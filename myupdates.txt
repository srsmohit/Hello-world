Admin panel

1) Throughout the admin panel, tabs - content listing, the title for the icons present in the Action column, is not correctly
   formated, also, in some places, the name is logically wrong.
2) Logically the processing(submit) buttons for any section - must have proper naming - Istead of submit, it must be save, etc
3) In Social Menus tab, the fields need to have URL validation as well. Eg: For facebook, only facebook url can be added, etc
4) The content tab section is not completed properly:
   - "Title" column, listing is not properly arranged, if there is some sub-title then show the parent title in bold
   - Above same points needs to be implemented, everywhere in the content page, where the titles list is listed
   - Edit content page is not in place
   - Add page, Body must be required field ...
   - Verify this full section properly
5) Users tab, search user is not working properly, consider the case mentioned below:
   - If I search for pankaj, it gives me 1 result ( correct )
   - If I search for pankaj, with User group as: Admin or User, it shows no result ( wrong ). It must have showed the
     result for either of the user group
6) Add/Edit user - http://endlessdeals.com/admin/user_edit/39
   - Fields validation is not correct, make sure proper and correct validations are performed
7) Products tab - JS validations are not present for add/edit product
8) Forgot password:
   - This is not working atall, though, an alert message, email sent ... is shown, but no email is sent
   - Also, only admin users, must be allowed to recover the password from here, for all other users, the alert message must
     be different, "You are not allowed to recover password from here!" - you may change the text
     
User panel

1) The admin user/pass login is still not working for me. Where do I log in as admin? Same as members' login?
2) I want to add a nice light blue or light green background color to the left sidebar? You can add this to admin panel, I may want to switch background color around later.
3) Move the "advance search" button to above the gray header line (but still below the "select sources:"). 
4) When I log in and out of the site, I get automatically redirected back to the homepage, I do not want to be redirected when logging in and out, make sure user stays on the same page as they were on.
   -The text with you are now log in or log out inside the red box can appear on the same page when user log in or out as well.


###########


User panel

1) Arrange the cities in alphabetical order
2) Deal listing page - the save deals button is not present on top of the deals listing
3) Allow only 5 comma separated keywords for searching - in the search results
4) User can add max 10 folders to his saved deals page, including default folders
5) Add delete button next to the add folder link - in my saved deals page
6) Show the Select all checkbox and Move deals button, on top as well as bottom of the deals listing page

7) The filters "deal prices" and "sort by" will appear in the advance search option AND in the deal results listing page at the top (as seen in the deals-page-REVISED.jpg).
   The advance search filters are good for new searches. And the same filters on the deal results listing page is for filtering the current deal page. It's just good to have the filters in both places.
8) All saved deals must show a checkmark sign with the text "saved" in search deals listing results when logged in. This way, users know exactly which deals they have already saved. Check screenshot.
   -Also all the check boxes need to be positioned in the middle of each deal instead of at the top of every deal. Check screenshot.
   -Add sort by and deal prices filter for search results, check screenshot.

Cron scripts
1) Change the support email address to "noreply@endlessdeals.com"
2) Prepare a cron script, to send new deals notification to the active users.
3) Setup aweber newsletter
4) Setup the duplicate city relation in the cron itself


Admin panel
1) Make use of rich text editor as used in Contents, for Templates and Contactus

Tasks Completed :: shelfsurvey ( Alex ) ( 07/03/2012 )

1) Study and implementation of AWS mturck API to create HIT
   - Implemented the class libraries, using the available techniques, but, the response from AWS mturk is - AWS.BadClaimsSupplied for timestamp


Tasks Completed :: endlessdeals.com ( Leon )

1) City selection is now working properly, as per the instructions
   - For the visitors - city is detected on the basis of IP address
   - For the logged in users - city is considered as the user city
   - If in case, for both the above cases, we get a city_name, that does not belongs to the US city list in the site,
     then the default, US city that is shown as selected, is "San Francisco"

2) When user logs in with facebook - "Endlessdeals com would also like permission to: Post to Facebook as me"
   - This confirmation message is always displayed, if the Facebook user is logging in, to endlessdeals.com, for the first time,
     this is an important step, internally handled by facebook. Without confirming this, facebook won't share the user basic
     information with us. Also, this confirmation message is shown to the facebook user, only once, If the user, has accepted
     to share his personal information, then this confirmation will never be asked again ever in future.

3) The "my saved deals" is not working as it should.	( fixed / implemented )
   -In the drop down menu "Go to another folder:", when a user select a folder from this drop down menu, this means literally load up the selected window in this page.
   -Next to the "add folder" button, make a "delete folder" button that pops up a window (just like the add folder button) and user can select any folder to delete.
   -The "Move deals" button, make this pop up a window, and user can select a folder to move selected deals to.

   Note :: The my saved deals section working is as follows:
   - The first time, an user, tries to save the deals, it automatically gets saved to "All saved deals" default user folder
   - The user can then add/delete the custom folders, from my saved deals section
   - Also, the user can move the saved deals, from one folder to the other, by simply selecting the deals, and moving the
     selected deals to the desired folder, by clicking on, the Move deals button

==========================================================================================================

Tasks Completed :: shelfsurvey

2) Change logo on report to attached logo
3) Change background color of report to white (so charts do not show white background)
4) Change background color of report to white (so charts do not show white background)
5) Re-arrange demographics section as shown in this attachment
6) Increase font size on headings (like "Demographics") to 30px.
7) Make the bar graphs on "Demographics" 1/2 the height. Make chart bars flat (not 3d beveled) if possible.
8) Make Demographics subheaders (like "Gender") same font size as "Demographics" but much lighter font weight (like 100 weight).
9) Add a rounded box around Demographics as shown. Make the box like the one here (with the clock) http://protowhite.com/.
That is a site I made recently so attached are the files, which may save you some time.
If possible, make the graphs have transparent background or match the background color.
10) Change "Amount they would pay right now" font size to 16px and center the "$15.56" beneath the text.
11) Add the new "Market size" chart as shown in attachment (choose some values to make it look like the attachment)

post view,
   Else if, Redirect post to ? has second option ( indeed.com ) selected, then we redirect the posts to the original
indeed.com post


Note: Both these settings are applied on all the posts together, as per the current indeedpress settings

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: Indeedpress

==== Indeedpress tab =======

1) Add a Post Type: Add functionality to "IndeedPress Tab"
The original plugin has a number of pieces of info it can post.  I need one more type added.
%%JOBTITLEPLUS%% - Displays "Job+Title" - Instead of displaying the Job Title with a space, displays the Job Title with a 
plus in the Wordpress Post 
( Done )

2) Add A Radio Box that Entirely Changes the Plugin's Functionality: Add functionality to "IndeedPress Tab"
The original plugin makes WP Posts that visitors view. If they want to look at the posting on Indeed.com, they click on a 
link to navigate to Indeed.com.
Add Radio Box to the Plugin - Go from Post Title Directly to Indeed.com Job Posting
Basically, when a Website Visitor Clicks on the Post Title, they are sent directly to the Indeed.com Posting and not to the 
WP Post
(Done)

====== The above features are activated, at the time, whent the job is actually posted on wordpress ========


===== Queries tab ======

1) Add Ability to Vary the Posting Time: Add functionality to "Queries Tab"
The original plugin pulls the XML Feed without giving the webmaster control of the post timing when they are setting up a 
new query.
Add the ability to control when the plugin pulls the XML Feed from Indeed.com and makes a WP Post. 
Add field "Post Every X Hours" - User can add any number of hours they want
( Done )

2) Add Ability to Randomize the Posting Time: Add functionality to "Queries Tab"
The original plugin pulls the XML Feed without control of the timing and without time randomization.
Add Radio Box "Randomize Posting Time"
Plugin then randomizes the post by +/-5 hours using the info from the field created above(Vary the Posting Time)
( Done )


Note: Here, the difference between point 1 & 2, is that, point is just defining the random cron time in hours, while, point 2
decides, whether to consider the random time, or simply, perform the WP job postings


3) Verified the working of the original indeedpress plugin settings for the wp postings. Also modified the code to fix the
bugs present therein. The settings are applied to only new posts that are created from the job listings.

4) Plugin verified by Arun sir, uploaded the plugin changes on demo.srs-infosystems.com
Tested and verified the working of the plugin features on server as well

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 04/01/2012 )

1) If the phone number is from a different country than the customer's home country, then we add the country code to the phone number, followed by a space, and then the rest of the phone number (e.g. +47 55 55 55 55). This means that for most of our customers, who have their address in Norway, Norwegian phone numbers would appear without the country code, while swedish phone numbers would appear with the country code. And the other way around, a swedish customer would receive messages from callers with a Norwegian phone number including the country code, but the country code for Sweden would be skipped etc). Again, we don't use spaces when sending phone numbers in SMS'es, and this also applies to the space between country code and phone number

 - Deactivating : Release all the assigned active line numbers of the subscription

7) When edit icon is clicked in the  manage call flow page, there are 4 options, on what do these options depend ? How can the options be managed, whether to list or hide the option for the selected, line number (phone number), in order to manage the call flow
 - Other than the first option ( Play default closed message ), all other options are dependent on the condition, whether they are active for the subscription or not
 - Play custom message -> this option is available, when "User defined welcome message" addon is activated for the subscription
 - Forward calls to a different number  -> this option is available, when "Call transfer basic or Call transfer plus" addon is activated for the subscription
 - Return busy-signal  -> this option is available, when "Play busy outside opening hour" addon is activated for the subscription

Note: The addons can be activated either manually for the subscription (if applicable, for the product). OR. The addon is automatically activated, if the addon is a feature.

1) Compose a new message issue ( fixed )
 - say there are 3 users : member1 , member2, member3
 - If member1 sends message to member2 and member3, the messages are sent successfully
 - If member2 replies to the message sent by member1, an alert message, "Communicaton with this member is no longer possible" is seen, and the message sending is blocked
 - If member3 replies to the message sent by member1, no alert message is seen, and the reply is sent successfully

This happens, because the preference settings for relation of member1, does not match the relationship_type preference setting of member2, while, it does match, the member3 preference setting

2) Show different alert messages, specifying the nudge type, sent, when any nudge is sent to the member

1) Cancel subscription popup -> Cance subscription button is not working as intended, study and fix the code.
2) Free the assigned lines, when a subscription is either manually cancelled by the CSR, or is automatically cancelled by the cron script.
3) In new order process, preserve product lines after, click on properties. Alos, reset the order values if changed.
4) Edit order -> Assign line number facility is not present
Note: When editing the order, we just provide facility to release line and/or deactivate the call transfer feature (whichever is applicable). Here, assigne new line or activate the call transfer option, is not allowed. Possibly, this could be the requirement, since, an invoice for the order - was already sent when the order is placed, and adding further chargeable features, could affect the cost of the subscription, and hece, could create disputes. This could be the reason, to block activating the features, when editing the order
5) Verify all the cpanel updates moved on server

6) Manage call history section - for televakt subscriptions in cpanel and customer portal
7) Manage televakt subscriprion hunt group
 - List all the hunt groups, with the count of assigned staff members
 - Facility to add new hunt group, and assign the staff members at the same time
 - Facility to edit the existing hunt group

29th - 30th December 2011

1) Upload and verify all the changes on test server, debug (if required) - (test server was working very slow)

2) Release and assign line numbers to either : Custom (general) contact, Staff member, and/or Department ( verify the code )

==== When creating a new order =====
i) When the new order is actually placed, we just reserve the line number, and not actually use the line number

==== When editing an order =========
ii) Here also, we just reserve the line numbers
Note: When editing the order, we just provide facility to release line and/or deactivate the call transfer feature (whichever is applicable). Here, assigne new line or activate the call transfer option, is not allowed. Possibly, this could be the requirement, since, an invoice for the order - was already sent when the order is placed, and adding further chargeable features, could affect the cost of the subscription, and hece, could create disputes. This could be the reason, to block activating the features, when editing the order

==== When the order is processed into subscription =====
iii) This is the point, where we actually assign the reserve line numbers


3) Draft caller information in the agent section - change the code logic to fit the new requirement (not fixed)

1) process to release line number
2) http://erp.televakt.no/cpanel/admin/index.php?page=phone_pool
- Rename "New phone pool" button to "Add New"
3) Run a sql query to blank out all release date where in use = yes
4) setup->phone number link does not work
5) Customer->Subscription->Televakt subscription:
   In subscripiton overview popup we have release line. This simply
   release the line which will be unavailable for next 90 days. But bjorn
   told to provide the ability to tranfer the line to different entities.
   eg say for subscription A line 6677888 assigned to user mohit but admin
   wants to assign this number to standard deparment of same subscription.
6) Customer card->Domain Control panel:
list is fine but when i mouse over "view" it shows the popup in contact type column. change the div position. This should appear near view link.
- use icons to represent "view, edit and change contact/change owner"
- for change owner/contact use "Boss.ico"
- Make sure to give proper tooltip also space between each icons should be
same.
- in popup (view) all the heading/title should be bold.

7) This point is not implemented correctly
"It should of course be possible to go back and edit the order ref/validation required before the order is registered. This should be done by clicking a button, let’s name it “Properties”"

8) Order view  -
When I try to process order I got this message "tNo record is selected"


9) Show translated contact numbers, in calls list, and caller contact information list

10) Save the tele_user_id or department_id or custom_id, if the message is distributed, on the email or contact_numbewr, same as that of one of the contact person
11) Search the caller history on the basis, of the caller name and the called for (contact person, to whom the message is distributed)
12) In the message section, if the to email and to sms fields, are left with the custom default value, then when registering call, show appropriate alret message

New order flow

iv) On the other hand, the button “Show PDF” has no place to be displayed in the new order popup, as we will likely not need to display a PDF of an order which is not yet placed. Same goes for the update button

v) The configure/delete buttons can remain at their current vertical positions. However, buttons for register/cancel order are not related to order lines and should be moved to a different position, perhaps up top. Same goes for the Properties button


Order view, registered orders:

i) Also remember to add the new information to the order view for registered orders. Save the info, order reference and order validator contact person

ii) Note that clicking on the “Update” button above the order lines in the order view processes all order lines which has a new status set in the drop down. The natural behavior would be to just update the order lines which are checked when pressing this button. When an order line is in a state which does not show a drop down (e.g. Processing/Processed), then do not show a checkbox to the left of the order line


Order verification screen (click link in email to verify the order):

i) The TOS checkbox(es) should be above the accept/decline buttons
ii) Note that the text “thank_you_order_message” appears misaligned with the rest of the page content if the text is long (try adding multiple paragraphs to this text and you’ll see what I mean, the text goes behind buttons, checkboxes etc)


Verification confirmation screen:

i) Currently we have the translation variable thank_you_confim_message present on this screen. However, if there are legal form requirements, we might not be able to fully process the order, hence we should use a different translation variable in such cases. I suggest the following text:

Your order has order lines which require a small, but important last step before we can process it in full: A signature! The below table lists products and services which are affected by this requirement. Please return the documents to us in a signed state so that we can complete the processing of your order.


Legal form (order flow):

There is currently some inconsistencies in the issuing of legal forms: Let’s say the CSR registers an order. He then checks the “legal form” and “verification required” checkboxes in the order registration popup (the legal form checkbox should be checked by default btw). The legal form is now sent alongside with the order confirmation request. Shouldn’t confirmation be carried out first? After confirmation, a new copy of the legal form is also being sent


Admin -> phone numbers

i) Phone number PDF work is not complete, Make entries in the table, and provide facility to view/download the pdf 


Agent 

1) Caller contacts
- Rename "status" to "line number"
- after contact name show icon for status.
2) Make sure you have paging in caller history list. If yes
what is the max record limit ( current limit is 10, but has been changed to 5 for testing, since less records available )
4) call history search is not working as intended
 - called for ( this is used to filter all the calls, that, has some messages distributed to the selected contact, and / or if the call is forwarded to the selected contact )
 - caller name ( this is also, working, but if there are some special chars, then for some reason, empty array result is returned )
criteria does not work

5) Above caller list show count of record. along with paging
6) Question answer selection on AJAX.

===== Database ====

1) Added 2 new fields "order_reference and order_validator" in customers table - to keep track of the contact persons, who are set as 
order reference and order validator

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 27/12/2011 )


1) When performing global search - for the products, mysql error is thrown. (Fixed)


System Admin -> setup -> phone pool

1) Create a new menu "Phone numbers" - A report to display phone number allocations (which customer and user has which phone number allocated), their allocation date and date of lastly logged call. Filterable on more closely defined numbering series (e.g. 53001841-53001850), and sortable on phone number (by default) or allocation date. A checkbox to include or exclude unallocated phone numbers (excluded/unchecked by default)


Setup -> Documents

1) Can we please have some short descriptions of the purpose of each document, as the names can be a little cryptic
 - The descriptions are now available for all the documents. This can be added, by updating the en_description and nb_descrtiption fields of the mails table

2) Also, please add a column which shows the last edited date
3) Lastly, how does the system determine which language to use when?
 - The system is, by default set to Norwegian language, and when the an extra parameter, param=en is added to the URL, then the site language changes to Englist, similaryl, if the request parameter, param=nb, then the site changes to Norwegian language


Subscription -> Domains -> Configure domain contacts

1) No need for a drop down to change between registrant/admin etc. contacts. We can display a table with the following information per row:

    Contact type
    Contact name
    Preview link (currently called view)
    Edit link
    Change link (named change owner for ownership transfers)"
2) Note that there is some issues showing Norwegian characters in names here. E.g. open the panel for inbook.no and view the admin contact and you’ll see what I mean


New order flow

i) I think we should have a new approach to registering orders through the CSR interface. When registering an order, we should select customer and then we should display a popup where we set the following properties:

Order reference:
This should be a drop down to select among existing customer contacts, as well as an option to add a new contact. This is typically the person who is calling or emailing us to have the order registered

Validation required
Checkbox. If checked, select which contact should validate the order. This can be the person mentioned in the “order reference” by default, but only if this person has admin privileges. If not, then we must select which admin that should sign from a drop down, or register a new one

Order date
(ii) When this popup has been dismissed, we can continue to the add order popup. Since we now have some information on the order already (order reference, and if needed, who is to validate the order), then we don’t need the checkbox on validation, as well as the drop down to select which contact that should validate the order. Instead, below country on the order information section, add the above information (order reference/validation) as readonly. The “Send email” and the “Legal form” checkboxes can be moved to the bottom of the right column in this section. The order date can now be readonly in the default order window

iii) It should of course be possible to go back and edit the order ref/validation required before the order is registered. This should be done by clicking a button, let’s name it “Properties”

===== Database =======

1) Added a new field "last_updated" to "partner_mails" table - to manage the timestamp the last time the document information was updated


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With ref to issue completed (0002418)

Log in time : 10:23 AM	Log out time : 8:00 PM  
Total Time = 9:30 Hrs ( appr. )
Lunch Break = 30 mins
Tea Break = Not taken

Online time available on work logger = 2:00 Hrs
Actual working time = ( 9:30 - 30 ) = 9:00 Hrs

So, extra time registered as offline = ( 9:00 - 2:00 ) = 7:00 Hrs
Offline registered = ( 7 x 60 ) = 420 mins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 26/12/2011 )

Partner section->Setup->Products->Televakt products

1) Addon : rename the options Disabled, Always Enabled and Enabled (cannot be disabled)     to    Disabled, Enabled, Enabled (cannot be disabled) 
2) Actually the difference between Enable and Enabled (cannot be disabled)  ?
 - Disabled : This means the addon/feature is disabled and will not be listed in the order or subscription when adding addons for the product
 - Enabled : When this option is selected for the add/feature, the customer when placing the order, can activate or deactivate this addon/feature
 - Enabled (cannot disable) : This option allows the customer to activate the addon for the product, but deactivating is not allowed (not possible)

3) Televakt timing: Is this where we set default *system* opening hours (that is, between which time intervals we should answer calls for customers who are subscribing to this plan)? If so we should make this a little clearer, so let’s rename this section to “Service hours”


Customer->Subscription->Televakt subscription:

"1) Something seems to be wrong here. First, there is an issue of not showing the line number for certain users (this could be due to dummy data though, but if not it should be investigated):
    [CHECK EMBBEDED IMAGE OF MAIL SUBJECT ""Feedback, Televakt""]     -   This means that the line number is listed as xx xx xx   rather than the actual assiend line number"
 - This is not an issue or bug, yes this case existed previously, since, the case for assigning random line numbers while placing an order, did not actually assined any number, when the order was actually converted into a subscription. This state is now managed properly and, whenever any random line number is assigned while placing an order, the randon number is actually replaced by the original available line number, when the order is subscribed
 - Consider an Eg: 
   (i) when the order is placed, and any random line number (xx xx xx xx) is assigned to the contact person, this random number is always represented as (xx xx xx xx) untill the order is actually subscribed.
   (ii) When the order is actually subscribed, the internal code automatically, assigns the random number (xx xx xx xx) - the original available line number (say 55 00 00 42)
  (iii) The same case is followed, when the subscription is edited, and a random number is assigned, when the content is saved, we automatically, assign a real available line number, for this case as well.
Conclusion : Hence, the problem of random number presentation  ( i.e., xx xx xx xx ) has been overcome, with the new implementation

2) Then, clicking on the staff member returns the following message in the top part of the popup: " Notice: Undefined offset: 0 in /hsphere/local/home/egoriaos0/erp.televakt.no/cpanel/library/class/televakt.class.php on line 1862 Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /hsphere/local/home/egoriaos0/erp.televakt.no/cpanel/library/class/televakt.class.php on line 1873"
 - not sure, what this error is, because, I got no error when testing similar case

3) I see no ability for the CSR to select among available televakt phone numbers from the pool when assigning a number to an entity
4)  I also see no ability for the CSR to remove a phone number from an entity if desired, or to add a phone number to the company or department entities
 - for both 3 & 4 points, the options will be available only if the Line Assignment (addon/feature) is available with the product. Also, if assigned, and if the max limit has been reached, then, further Lines cannot be assigned, untill and unless, any previous line of the subscription is released


Customer -> Order -> New order -> Add televakt Product -> Configure

1) Custom info: Note that http/https should not be required for the website URL
2) I see no ability to assign a line number to the company or department entities
 - This could be due to possible reason, that, there must be no Line Assignment (addon/feature) is active for the subscription, and/or the max limit for using the Line Assignment addon has reached

3) Furthermore, I see no ability for the CSR to select among available phone numbers in the pool (reserve phone numbers).
 - when the order is placed actually and a line is assigned, thill this time, the line number is not reserved, but when the order is actually registered, by clicking "Register order" button, the assigned line number is just reserved and not assigned
 - If the placed order is declined / canceled, then the reserved line number is freed, and will be available for all other customers.
 - when the order is processed (i.e., a subscription is generated of the order) - all the assigned lines that were reserved, will now be actually assigned.
 - when the assigned line number is released from the televakt subscriptions section : the line number is released, and will not be available for any user, untill, it was released way back 90 days before (only released lines, that are 90 days older) will be available for reassigning to others

"4) Unchecking the options send email and order verification (after preconfiguring) and then clicking on Register order, I get an error stating “No items in cart”. Also, in the background, I see that an error message appears in the orders tab:
    [CHECK EMBBEDED IMAGE OF MAIL SUBJECT ""Feedback, Televakt""]
    It is worth noting, however, that the order is actually registered, despite the error messages."
 - The issue has been fixed, but, when both the checkbox ( send email and send verification mail ) are left unchecked, then we redirect the CSR to the order lists page, on the basis of the order status

5) Question: How do I activate more options to control call flow from within the televakt subscription->call flow section?
 - The Manage Call flow section will always be available for a televakt subscription, that has atleast 1 active line number assigned


Customer card->Invoice tab

1) The translation for “duplicate”, is that in use multiple places throughout the system? Because the Norwegian translation appears to be incorrect. If it is use throughout the system, please create a separate variable for the duplicate feature and add the Norwegian translation “Dupliser”. If not, just change the translation in the nb.php file accordingly
2) Clicking the invoice duplication feature should not just create a draft, but should open the draft on the CSR’s screen too
3) A duplication button should also be added to existing invoices


Order screen 

1) New order : When adding a .no registration to the order, the legal form checkbox should be checked by default
"2) Some inconsistencies exist: Try the following:
    
    Go to customer 33047 (comsoft). Notice how two contacts have been registered (srs_bjorn@egoria.no (Bjorn Ove Kristiansen) and bjorn@egoria.no (Bjorn Kristiansen)). Notice also that I have changed the default domain contact to the latter (bjorn@egoria.no).

    Now, create a new order. You’ll notice that the system automatically suggests srs_bjorn@egoria.no as the contact that should verify the order (weakness, I’ll get to this later on)

    Add a domain name under .no. Go to configure. You’ll notice that the system suggests srs_bjorn@egoria.no as the default contact (bug)"



System Admin -> setup -> phone pool

1) Release date - When a phone number is in use, there should be no release date. This date is set to release the phone number from quarantine (so that it can be assigned to a new customer) after the previous customer has cancelled this number. E.g: if company A is assigned 53001841 and cancel their subscription, let’s say it ends on July 31st, their phone number gets status inuse=no. At the same time we’d like to prevent assigning this number to a new customer immediately afterwards, because from experience some callers might still try to reach the previous customer on this phone number for some time (we don’t answer these calls, but by not assigning the number to a new customer, we also reduce the chance of callers calling for the wrong customer). Hence, we set a quarantine date (release date) for this phone number. As soon as this date has been reached, the release date can be cleared, as the number is now available to be reassigned.

2) Corrected the UI for the phone pool - buttons were not properly placed
3) The total phone numbers in the phone pool per page, must be 10, but the list count changed reandomly. Fixed this to count of 10 always
4) Removed the un-necessary phone initial +41 from the phone numbers
5) Add a new field, in the phone pool table to represent the resered phone number
6) Add a new field, in edit phone pool popup, to update the reserved status of the phone number

exists any previous contents in the RHS, then show the confirmation popups to the agnet, whether to load the content or not.
2) When the page is refreshed or the internet crashes, the call list must be populated as it was previously
3) Also, when loading the previous call list, also, make sure that the call selected last time, must be automatically selected, with 
the correct contents being populated for the same
4) In the asterisk call - check if the incoming line number, has a valid subscription. The subscription must not be canceled or deactivated
List the call as a ringing call, only, if the subscription is active

====== Database =======

1) Added a new field, 'last_updated' - to the televakt_callers_draft table

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 21/12/2011 )

1) In the contact person list table, if the custom general information comes blank, then by default, show the main customer info, there
2) Rework and modify the caller details section in General tab, to display the correct logical implementations
3) Remove the code that update the last_updated value of the inuse extension
4) Change the listing elements in the call list table, first column will have : caller name & caller number, second : line number, third : status

5) When the call is actually answered:
   - pre condition, check if the caller phone number is available in the ignore list or not
   - first check if for the incoming caller number, there exists any tele caller, if yes popuplate them, if 1 - list him in editable form
   - if no result, then check the cache table for the phone number, and perform the same functionality
   - if still no results, then perform the external lookup, and the same process

6) Explained ERP project to junior


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 20/12/2011 )

1) When the agent extension is switched, check if the agent was previously on some other extension, if yes, then delete that entry from the table
in order to free up the extension for other agents

2) Update the last_updated time for the inuse extension, in order to identify that the extension is not ideal, and is in use by an agent

"3) In asterisk call pass agent current session_id (encrypted)
    - before doing any operation eg ""wait_event"" run a query and check whether session_id->agent_id pair is available in db. if not return XXXX.  
    - In js if XXXX received redirect user to extension list page with message ""Your selected extension is now in use by another agent. Please choose any other from below list"". "

4) Currently, when clicking the logout link, this doesn’t free up the agent’s extension (fixed)

5) General tab:
    - Caller’s email: Not a required field
    - Phone: Why can’t I edit this phone number?
    - This phone number is non-editable, since, it’s the number from which the call came, and this won't change for sure. Only, if the number is a private or blank number, then the calling number is editable

    - There seems to be issues with the lookup feature not filtering duplicates. A call from my cellphone 93092266 to 53001841 displays two entries from the phone book, but they both carry the same information, at least apparently

   - In the event that we have multiple matches on the caller from internal and external lookups, and the caller has also been in touch with us before, I suggest that the most recently used data appears on top (e.g. if there are four matches on the phone number from internal and external lookups, the system should remember which entry the agent used last and display that entry on top of the list of matches)

6) I also think that we should use icons when displaying matches to indicate the source of the match. Let’s use the following icons:
     - Phonebook.ico: Phone book
     - Database.png: Internal lookup

     - The phone book lookup has issues with character encoding. E.g. my name appears as “Kristiansen BjÃ¸rn Ove”, instead of “Kristiansen Bjørn Ove”.

7) Even though we find matches when doing internal or external lookups, we should still have the ability to register info manually. The ability to do so exists, but if matches are found, we first have to select one of the matches and then blank out the form, which isn’t very logical if the matches found are not representative to the caller (e.g. we find a match for Bob, but the caller’s name is Betty). Hence, I suggest that when matches are found, above those matches show an entry in the list which is named “Enter new caller details”, along with the “Select” button (this is to appear as the very first entry in the list)

PHONE BOOK INTEGRATION

1) Fetch the phonebook search result from the external API vendor, that returs the search results in vcard format. (plain search)
2) Prepare a normal array out of the returned result, and make use of the required fields
3) The external search results obtained, are saved in the cache table, so, that, we can directly use the records from the cache table
rather than making the external search again ( this will be done, if the last search was made, within 3 months)


4) ALgo for making internal & external lookup work together properly

i) Make internal lookup, in televakt_callers table
ii) If no results are found, in internal lookup, search for the data, in the external lookup cache table, that is not older than 3 months
iii) If still there are no results found, then only, make the external lookup
   - also, check the entered number, must be a valid number and not a string or special char. must be numeric value only
   - also, validate the condition, that the entered number, is a norwegian number only. since, the external lookup is for norwegian numbers only
   - the external search results, will be independent of the subscription_id .... It will be same for all

5) Agent API section is not working. Tried to fix the issue, but its, not working properly.
   - possible reson for its malfunction would be changes, made in the wsdl, interface, etc .... API files

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 15/12/2011 )

1) When the status of the call is changed, from Ringing to Answered, we show an alert message - confirming whether to load the call content now or not
2) If the agent confirms, to switch the call, then the previously received/active call information is drafted (if any)
3) If the agent denies, to switch the call, then, the call, is maintained in the call list and the agent can switch on the call later, by simply cliking the call
4) When the call is Registered or Canceled, the call, must be removed, from the call list (Hence, from the API session)

5) Displaying the contact numbers, in a particular format, when listing the caller info, or sending caller info, via email, depending on certain conditions, as follows:

A little note on phone number appearance: We know how to determine which numbers are landline and cellphone numbers in Norway based on their leading digit (0 for special numbers, 2,3,5,6,7 for landline, 8 for special numbers, 4,9 for cellphone numbers). Their appearance should be as follows:

0: XXXXX (e.g. 02695)
landline: XX XX XX XX (e.g. 22 33 44 55)
cellphone: XXX XX XXX (930 92 266)
8: XXX XX XXX (e.g. 800 31 031)

This should be how such numbers are shown on screen and in emails, but for the sake of preserving space, we do not use spaces inbetween digits in SMS'es.

6) Show proper status background color, for the call listing table:
    - yellow : Ringing call (incoming call)
    - red : Answered call 
    - pink : Ended call
    - blue : currently selected call

7) Worked with sir, in order to identify the issue related to the PBX server response, and changes in the status of the calls

6) Correction of layout in all browsers

====== Database =======

1) Added new fields "contact_special_number_0, contact_special_number_8, contact_landline_number, contact_cellphone_number" in site_validation_rule table


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 13/12/2011 )

1) Make sure, that the caller details, and / or the caller details form,   and the  basic history section, both have same height and alignments
2) Utilize both the column space, to display the actions and the message section area

3) The Register call and Cancel call buttons, must be placed at the bottom of the General tab content area, and not within the Edit details area
4) Let's try to move the "Edit info" checkbox to the top of the section, just below the Caller details/Edit details header. Also, let's replace the blank form checkbox with a button and display it to the right of the edit info checkbox, but only display this button if we are showing the editable form
5) No need to display the # column in the last 5 calls history section. Also, please make sure that the column and column headers are aligned properly
6) List the call duration in the format of mins & secs (if available)

7) Please adjust the box around the staff table so that there is not so much blank space below it. Also, list the contacts in a scrollable content, if the count of the contacts is more than a certain value. Say 5
8) Note that the system complains about me not selecting a message template, so I haven't been able to test the message sending feature (no message templates exist, however, I should still be able to manually type in and send a message)

Caller history tab:
9) "Receiver name" header should be replaced with "Agent"
10) Time is listed in 24-hour format, but with AM/PM, which is incorrect. Please use PHP's date locale date/time formatting 
11) To the right of the "Caller name" column should be a "Called from" column (the number which the call came in from) 
"12) The search parameters should be as follows (in this order):
*       Date range
*       Caller name
*       Caller number
*       Called for (staff member/department)
*       Incoming line (currently called line number)"

13) Change the status of the incoming call from Ringing to Answered, automatically, when the call is actually received by the Agent
14) When the call is actully ended from the PBX server, we update the status of the call, to Ended, so that , the agent can actually determine, which call is still being answered, and which one is ended

15) Removed the mandatory fields, validation from, alternate number and message templates, available in the General tab
16) when the main notification is sent to the receiver mail, and if, the message template was not selected, then we only send, the entered
message body content as the main content of the email notification
17) Made use of encrupted text content - in the caller history popups section to manage the special chars

Extras
1) Setup of Agent access account - for receiving the incoming calls (X-Lite)
2) Prepared the bug list (issues) still present in the call list generation (communication with the PBX)
Old API server backup moved on server
3) webservice_old  - interface.php, wsdl.php
4) televakt_controller_ol - ArrayToXML.php, Call.php, Cust.php, ErrorHandler.php, Helper.php, OrderProducts.php, Sub.php, Usr.php, Validate.php

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 12/12/2011 )

1) Verify the following points, in order to confim the working of the Agent section code :
 - check if proper entries are being made, in, televakt_calls, televakt_callers, etc …. Tables
 - check if the, assigned departments for the selected call subscription, are available for the proper timing (make them available, from 0600 - 2400)


2) Spit the Agent section code into normal code and API code, into 2 different files, that will work on 2 different URL's individually
   - define a variable that will differentiate, whether the request is from the api code or from the normal code
   - set the logical, insert, update, delete, fetching related codes, centrally in the class files, that will be commonly accessed by both

==== cpanel -> System admin ====

1) In the setup -> general tab : Televakt ignore list . This is to manage the phone numbers that are to be ignored, for the lookup in agent


====== Agent =======

1) asterisk.js : For the color change when the call is selected from the caller list. Consider the 'Link' status in place of 'Newexten'
2) event_status.php : For now, the context_value condition is checked with, default and egoria-testaccess, remove the last condition
and keep only the default condition.

====== This change is not working, since, the context_value comes to be egoria-testaccess    and  not default !!!

3) agent_dashboard.php : Add the code, to authenticate the asterisk login - in show_api_interface()  function

4) If there are no previous call history, then show, no records available alert message, in the call history section of General tab

5) When the call is selected, and there are no previously defined tele callers for the call, then show the blank form by default, with
all the defaul values.

6) When the caller information is registered :
   - verify if the selected caller information (if any) has the same data information as that of the enetered information
   - if the values mismatch, the compare the entered data, with that of the other televakt subscription callers information
   - if still the values mismatch, then register a new caller, else, set the caller id of the matched, caller

7) When performing the search for the caller information, we first lookup, in the ignore list, if the calling number exists, in the ignore
list, then we don't do further caller search, and skip the search process, by setting blank caller details.

3) Prefill the Email and SMS values, in the message section, with that of the selected caller contact email & cellphone (if any)
4) When the caller general information is saved:
   - if the caller form data and the selected caller information (if any) is same, then do nothing
   - if both caller form data and the selected caller information (if any) is different
     - check if any other caller for the subscription has the same details, if yes, then update only the caller id
   - else register a new

2) Implementation of new points related to message template, drafting calls, show only, End call button


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 01/12/2011 )


=========	API CODES

1) Corrected all the API codes, along with implementation of new ones
2) The whole agent section is now running on the API code


1) Corrected the search functionality for the caller contact list
2) Corrected the partner country list generated by the API code
3) Corrected the Message template listing issue generated by the API code


===========	NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS 	============

########    AGENT    ##########

1) Change the code, to accept the input parameters from the selected calls as follows:
   - Request params : line_number, unique_id, calling_number, caller_name
   - Session params : logged agent information, along with the selected extension details

2) The contact person search box present below, the call list table, is implemented as per the requirement ( the whole list refresh, rather 
than suggesting the contact person )

   LIMITATIONS ========

   - Fast typing will not filter out the search results properly, because, it takes some time to get the result from server and print it
   - Blank space between two words, will not be accepted, since, when the request goes, the space, gets trimed out.
   - Also, if there are lot of search results obtained, for a key, it may slow down the search operation and all other AJAX requests

   SUGGESTION =========

   - The previous one, showing auto suggestion, will work fine, as the content it requests from server is minimum, also, its faster.

3) The message sections, message templates list is now generated, from the central list and the subscription specific message templates

4) When the caller information is drafted, the selected message template is according saved, in the central or subscription related field



#######    Cpanel / Customer portal    #########

3) Define televakt message templates centrally ( system admin ), rather, than partner specific. This can be edited only by the admin

4) Televakt message templates, can be defined, subscription specific, as well. Also, the for the agent, we will list all the centrally defined
message templates, in addition to the subscription specific message templates.




=======	Database =========

1) Replaced the field asterisk_id by unique_id, in the following tables:
   - televakt_calls
   - televakt_callers_draft

2) Renamed the table, televakt_msg_partner_tpl   to   televakt_msg_central_tpl
3) Removed the field, partner_id, from televakt_msg_central_tpl   and   televakt_msg_subscription_tpl

4) Removed the field, message_template from televakt_callers_draft table

3) The agent, when asked which entry to use, will have a SELECT button. But at the very same time he should also have a OUTDATED button. 
By clicking the outdated button, the caller info will be marked as outdated and removed from the list. It will not reappear again when 
taking next call from 98888888 (in other words, the entry is treated as if it was expired).

4) Make sure that the caller general information is drafted when the call is switched, only if, 
   - If caller is selected : the manual input button is clicked (selected)
   - If no caller is available : draft always

5) When the caller general information is saved or drafted, the calling number, is not properly saved. Verify and correct this.

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 18/11/2011 )

1) When the call is received by the caller, also, update the asterisk_id value, in the televakt_calls table. This will act

2) Keep asterisk_id as the main reference id.
3) When the tele callers are listed for the selected call, show, the tele customer basic information in the tooltip.
4) Once, a tele caller is selected, the agent, cannot reselect another caller, for the selected call.
5) Add a new button, Draft - When this is clicked , save all the information in the new table, and when the agent, returns 
back on this call, auto populate the last entry, from the log table.  If again the draft is clicked, then the data is updated.
6) When the call is registered or ended, then remove the entry from the draft table.

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 17/11/2011 )


Cpanel - New order configure popup -> General

1) By default, show the Customer information in readonly format, with a set custom button. When the set custom button
is clicked, the form becomes editable, and a new button Save changes is replaced, with the set custom button, when
the save changes button is clicked, then we make entry in the custom information table, else, always consider the 
main customer information, from the customers table.
2) Make sure that, the phone number and cellphone are saved, for general + staff + department, only, if the values 
are entered (means not blank). Otherwise, leave it blank.
3) When the order is processed, we make entries in the temp tables. Verify for the correct data inserted in tables.
4) When the order is actually accepted, and a subscription is created, we move all the order data from temp tables, 
to their corresponding subscription related tables. Verify for the correct data moved.

5) When order is subscribed : Assign line number, to General + Staff member + Department ( whichever is applicable ) : 
   - when the order is placed, we just reserved the line number, for this order.
   - When the subscription is created, here, we actually assign the line number, in reality.
   - If the reserved line was the selected line number, then, update the inuse and reserved_in_order status fields
   - If the reserved line was a random line number, then, search for any available, free line number, and assign it.
   - If in case, the assigning, line number fails, due to any reason, then make an entry in error_log table for reference.

6) When order is cancelled : Free up the reserved line numbers for General + Staff member + department ( if any )
   - When the order is placed, and for any section, we assign line number, the line number at this time is not actually 
     assigned, but is kept reserved for the selected section, and is actually assigned, only, when the order is 
     subscribed.
   - It means the reserved line will not be available for further use.
   - Since, when an order is cancelled, there is no sense, in keeping the line number reserved, hence, we free up all 
     such line numbers, that were reserved for the order.

Agent view

7) Previously, all the caller information, was saved and was considered, from om_caller_customer table, replace, this 
with the televakt_callers table. This will be the main caller reference table here.

Tasks Completed :: ERP 	( 04/11/2011 )

Admin view
1) It would be convenient to be able to view which televakt subscription/company name on that subscription a phone number has been assigned to. Default sorting should be on phone numbers. Also, it would be nice to be able to search and filter on phone number, customer name, availability, status and release date tomorrow. This should get you started on the day though.
 - search functionality is not implemented (will be done later as per Arun sir's instruction)

2) Required fields for order module create customer: It should be up to our customer (the televakt customer) to define which fields are required. Default required fields are First name, last name, address line 1, zip and city, and company name for the company customer, but this should be configurable form the configuration section of the order module

3) Change the setup section of admin panel, just like done in customer portal

Extras

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 01/11/2011 )

1) Notifications: This is an area which needs some more attention. There are multiple types of things one can get notified of. First it's our televakt customer, they typically want to be informed about orders coming in, the question is *what* (new orders, change in orders, order cancellations), *when* (once per order, or once daily), *how* (by email, SMS or both) and *where* (who receives them?). But then there is also the question of how to inform the customer placing the order (email, sms, both) and of what (new order, changes, cancellations, delivery). To accommodate all these settings, I propose two sections within the notifications tab:

2) Customer notifications (for notifying the one actually placing the order):
Have a table with one row for each of the following:
New order
Status update
Then have the following columns:
Email (checkbox)
SMS  (checkbox)
The admin must here be able to define from which address the emails and SMS'es are to be sent. SMS addresses (from-address) can be numerical, or they can be alphanumeric. Remember that alphanumeric addresses have a limit of 11 characters.

3) Admin notifications (for notifying *our* customer, the one owning the subscription):
Rows:
New order
Status update
Columns:
Email (checkbox)
SMS (checkbox)
In addition to the notifications table in the admin notifications section, this section must also contain a way to define who should get notified. One should select email address and cellphone number from drop downs. For emails, this drop down will contain the default company email address, department email addresses and all staff email addresses (remember that the drop down must also contain names of departments, staff members etc), and the same with SMS (but of course, only where a cellphone number exists for each staff member).

4) At the very right of each notification table should also be an icon that can be clicked to edit the template used to send out notification SMS and emails. For both customer portal and admin panel


EXTRAS ::

5) Assigned tasks to preeti
6) Verified the tasks done by preeti. And prepared the bug list of the points done by her.
7) Assigned tasks and provided help and support to Sushil

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 31/10/2011 )

Register order (CSR)
1) The legal forms checkbox should not be visible if products that do not require legal forms are the only products in the cart. E.g. right now, the products should be configured so only .no registration (not renewals, not transfers) require legal forms, but the checkbox still appears, even if the order is for a televakt service

Preconfigure televakt subscritpion (CSR view)
2) The edit opening hours (departments): Please use a different translation variable as the Norwegian translations appears to be wrong
===== Status: Translations are correct. If any, please specify via screenshot image.

3) I see nowhere to assign a line number either at the company level or department level, only at the user level
===== Status: The facility to assign line number, is available, only if the Call transfer addon is activated for the subscribed product, and there are free lines available for use.

4) After preconfiguring a televakt order and clicking the register order window (all checkboxes unchecked), nothing happened, and the popup did not close. Clicking the register order button once more yielded an error message stating that there were no products in the cart. This is a bug.


Customer portal -> Order module

5) No need to select which subscription to enter the order module for if it's only active on one subscription. However, if more than one subscription is active, then the table of subscriptions should include the company name of which the subscription has been labeled


Company customer: 

6) EIN field should be at the top, but shorter than the customer  name field. Currently it is the oposite
7) Address line 2 doesn't need a label
8) Zip / City can be combined into one label. Zip code can be a short (six characters large in size, but not limited to six characters of input) text field, and the city can take the rest of the space
9) Contact: Email field goes below cellphone. Generate password should be a button and not a link

Consumer customer (Contact person):
10) Same changes as above.
11) Please see to it that phone number/cellphone fields end at the same positions as the other fields (currently they end a little further to the right)


Product management:
12) Reorder: Please rename the reorder label in this section to "Minimum inventory".
13) Question: What happens if I set a value here, e.g. 10, and the value of the inventory goes below this value - am I still allowed to place orders? Does it trigger alerts (and if yes, to who?). Please elaborate
==== Status : For the current scenario, we have not managed,  any place from where the caller can place the order, this will be managed from the .net application via API

14) Seems like the create product page contains some test data, like the product number (statically defined to be 100008) and vehicle. This should have been catched when reviewing the system
==== Status : The product number is automatically generated, and is actually the new number for the product, from customer preference.


Setup: 

15) The header appears to be "Etabl" in Norwegian, which certainly is incorrect. Please use a separate header variable for this section, it should read "Innstillinger".
16) No need for the text "No entries exist" below the "add" button of the category list. It's quite obvious that no categories exist if they are not listed there.
17) I also think that the setup page is rather messy; it is a very unclear distinction between the category list, the order module settings, the televakt customer preference and the shipping list. My suggestion:

First, let's introduce tabs:
    - General: Handles category listing and numbering series
    - Shipping
    - Notifications

18) Then, if more than one type of settings are administered within one tab (like the general setting which contains both category listing and numbering series): Please have a look at how we have separated the various sections in the staff part of the televakt subscription setup, with clear headers and lines that form a box between each section. Please do the same here

19) The labels in the "Televakt customer preference" table are wrong. They currently read "Action", "Start" and "End" (Handling, Start, End in Norwegian), but it should be "Numbering series", "Start" and "Next available", where next available is the next number that the system will suggest to use when creating e.g. a new order or a product # (remember to always check that this number, or whatever number that might be inserted into this field manually, does not represent a taken number when creating the actual order, product, customer etc. If I try to 100001 into the customer_number next available box, then if a customer already exists with this number, then I should not be allowed to enter it, but more importantly, if I for some reason still am able to enter it into the box, the system must still check if this customer # is available upon creating the actual customer, no duplicate numbers can ever exist on one and the same order module!)
20) The labels "PRODUCT_NUMBER", "CUSTOMER_NUMBER" and "ORDER_NUMBER", why are they appearing like that, and not like "Product #", etc.?

21) I currently get "Error in server response" when trying to register a customer. This makes me unable to test the order module further in regards to registering and processing orders (note that the televakt customer should also be able to register orders, not just the televakt agents).

Customer portal -> subscription order module

1) Dont show existing subscrition page to select the subscription when i 
click on "Switch subscription". create a new list.

2) CSR view: "Switch subscritpion" should be a normal link (reduce the size)

3) "Configure order module" should only appear in subscritpion popup if the addon is active.
Means suggest only those subscriptions, that has order module as an active addon

4) System admin-> televakt usages pricing popup
Rename "Operation" to "Action"
   - In the same popup price field should accept "comma"
     eg 12,56. It will be stored in db as 12.56

available in drop down
customer_calls_system, system_calls_customer, customer_writes_script, busy_outside_op_hours, msg_outside_op_hours

10) Give me update where we are making entry in customer order lines for above
services. we need to enable the facility to deactivate this service too.

11) In billable2invoice script: - Add few lines of code to read the data from
televakt_usages table and make an entry in invoice_products table.
(invoice.class.php->perform invoice processing ->insert_into_invoice_products_table)
 - make entry in the ivoice_products table, for the charged televakt_addon 
 - update the billed televakt addon usage entry in the televakt_usages table


1) customer card->balance details
 - besides amount create a new column "outstanding balance"
 - In footer show sum of outstanding balance
 - if reminder fee is paid subtract it - in other words show the current reminder balance
 - if interest fee is paid subtract it - in other words show the current interest balance.

Hint: you have 2 functions "get_letter_fee" and "get_collection_fee"
assume letter fee function returns 60 and the date last letter was sent
is 2011-10-10. Assume on 2011-10-12 you received 40 as letter fee for same
invoice so final letter balance is 20.

2) use the same function "reminder/interest", in register payment popup to maintain the paid fees

Cpanel -> Invoice details 
1) First of all, if the customer's billing country <> the partner's country (typically, Norway), can we have the country appear on the invoice as well? Attached is an invoice for a customer that has their home base in England. Hence, we cannot send reminders to them because the country is not present on the invoice.
2) Secondly, can we expand the CSR view of invoices so that the CSR can tell who has added a specific invoice line? This can be useful especially when trouble shooting billing issues (when making additions to a system generated invoice, f.i.). I propose a column to the right in the invoice line section that simply states "System" or the name of the CSR that has added the line.

Order Module API code

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 27/09/2011 )

Order module

- Auto trigger the order configure popup, when any televakt product is added.
- Refresh the parent order lines popup, only when the order configure popup is closed.

Adding products:

- System should suggest a product # on the add product page. This number can be changed if desired. 
- Below product # there should be a "Product name" field. This is the name of the product. This field should also have focus when entering the add product page
- We don't need a separate pricing box on the add product page, as we will only be entering one price for this product at this stage anyway (if we'd like to set future prices, this can be done at a later time). Hence, let's just add an input field, Net Price, below the inventory count and let's remove the pricing table with valid from info. The price entered will automatically be valid from today's date. 
- Below the net price, add a VAT drop down. Use the VAT rate that has been set as default by the customer (we must have an ability to set VAT rates on a per order module basis. The admin must also have the option of defining which VAT rates are copied to the order modules by default, and then the customer can add more rates as desired)
- Below that again, add a total price field. We should allow to enter a price into both the net price field and the totals field. Setting price in one field automatically updates the other and vice versa. Let me give you an example:
- VAT rate is 25%. Entering 100,00 in the net price field will generate 125,00 in the totals field. Entering 250,00 in the totals field will generate 200 in the net price field.
- Correction in the shipping cost

ORDER MODULE -> MANAGE ORDERS 
1) No need of showing field, serial number.

ORDER MODULE -> MANAGE ORDERS -> VIEW ORDER
2) Order date:- :- 09/08/11     must be replace by     Order date:- 09/08/11
3) The date format throughout the system must be same. For the 2) point specified above, the date format is different from that used for: Order Date, Order Delevery Date, etc ... 
4) No need of showing the field, serial number, under order products lines section
5) Add notes section is missing
6) Cancel order popup is not implemented as per the requirement
7) In Properties and History popup --> History section ( The resend link, must be replace by buttons )

ORDER MODULE -> MANAGE PRODUCTS
8) Breadcrumb missing
9) No need of showing serial number
10) Edit/update pricing should be done from the same edit page. As for our own products, we have a top section with various attributes like name, product #, and then we have the pricing lines appear below with each price having a “from” date.
    - This point is not properly implemented. Also, the design is not correctly formated as per the design pattern of the customer portal.
11) Inventory update can be done from within the single product management page, but it is also nice to have the option to just click a link to edit inventory. In that case, this should trigger a popup which shows the following: .....
    - This point is also not implemented as per the specification. Alos, make the design consistent. The fields should be of same length.
12) In the ADD/EDIT price section : The plus symbol icon and the edit icon symbol, are not having, style="cursor:pointer;". Also, breadcrumb missing.

ORDER MODULE -> CUSTOMERS
13) The search box is not properly formated (design, align it with the table design used below)
14) What is the use of DELETE button, below the customer list ?????? No place to select the customers, that we intend to delete.
    - Suggestion :: There must be checkbox, in front of the customer number.

ORDER MODULE -> CUSTOMERS -> Edit
15) Again the design is not properly aligned, with the menu width. Fields are not properly aligned, width.
    - Customer information table ( alternate row color )
    - Similarly, the table design of the tabs below
    - Breadcrumb missing
16) Make sure, that the dates are formated same throughout the system

ORDER MODULE -> CUSTOMERS -> Add
17) The design seems to be not correctly formated. Breadcrumb missing. No back button.

ORDER MODULE -> CUSTOMERS -> Contacts tab -> Edit/View
18) Fields are missing. Design incorrect

ORDER MODULE -> CUSTOMERS -> Orders tab -> Edit/View
19) When I click the back button, it takes me to the orders page, while, it must have redirected me to the customer details page.

ORDER MODULE -> CUSTOMERS -> Notes tab
20) Add some dummy notes, and list them in tabular format, faciltate edit and delete operation

ORDER MODULE -> SETUP
21) Descriptve/help text are missing throughout the setup section. As per the requirement, the should have been some help text for each section here.
22) Design not proper
23) Delete icon should have atleast a confirm message, or should do nothing, right now, its refreshing the page.

ORDER MODULE -> SETUP -> Add shipping list
24) Rename the title: price and Vat    to    Shipping fee and VAT level. Align the fields properly ( left align, increase the width of the text fields ).

ORDER MODULE -> SETUP ->Set Price link
25) Breadcrumb missing. Design not proper. 
26) Replace cancel button by back button
27) Currecny symbol, should be same throughout the system, for nb=kr and for en=$. Also, the $ currency symbol should be presen outside the text field, for the prodcut price.
28) Same changes for add price popup, as done for point 27)

============
QUESTION / SUGGESTION
1) Customer subscription # should be replaced by “Ordered via” and the name (either the custom name of the televakt subscription or the name of the company if no custom name exists. This is better than just a subscription reference because our customer in the event of having multiple televakt subscriptions will not remember their subscription # anyway).
Ans: Here, its asked to replace, subscription # by ordered via.  But, how can a subscription # be available for an unprocessed order. Also, subscription # will be availabe when the orders subscription is created. No logic of showing subscription # in order view page

2) Under the order lines : What is the actual difference between : Net amount  and  Total excl. vat ????
Ans : Here, the net amount is the total amount of the product lines, which is already the price excl. VAT

12) Write now when we upload userdefined welcome message or other 2 properties
it updates televakt_fproduct_meta. It is possible that customer may overwite previous 
upload with a new file. We need to manage the history. To achieve this allow multiple entries of same key for same subscritpion in televakt_fproduct_meta but manage a field
"Active 0/1" and "approved 0/1". This filed will be 1 for any one entry. U also need some regression in existing code after implementation of this logic.
- If file is uploaded through CSR the value of "approved" will be 1. but if uploaded by customer its value will be 0. until CSR review the upload and approve it manualy. If approved the selected line "Active" status will be 1 and rest will become 0.
 
13) In webservices where we fetch this value for API perform regression to fetch the correct filename.
 
14) http://localserver/cpanel/admin/index.php?page=subscriptions
in very right of "Standard" tab create a link "Pending approval (xxx)". This will 
open a new page which will show all the userdefined welcome message and user defined messages which has been uploaded by customer and awaiting approval.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: ERP ( 01/09/2011 )

1) compare web medium->upgrade/downgrade section on production DNS pack is available in list but on test server it is not.
- This is because, the product DNS-pakke is addon for other products. Hence, via script, we changed its product_type to 'Addon'. Hence, its not visible in the products Upgrade/Downgrade section, as only products of type Product, are displayed here.

2) For addons use "Max_unit" = 1 as default (Make this change in code of script. On test server since we have already imported the records so run a sql query to update this field.)
- Resolved

3) "Enable status" options should be same in "add addon" popup as present in products->addons list.
- Resolved

4) logged in as system admin and viewing "Add Product addon" popup. This popup has options "show qty, max unit, free unit" and then in second line "enable status".
All these should be present in tabular format and in one row. The heading will be "Show qty, max unit, free unit, status"
- Resolved

5) In televakt subscription popup (cpanel) show subscription number in title eg: televakt subscription #455445
- Resolved

6) Televakt subscription  --> Featured services ( clickable red/green icons )
- If the partner has set 'Disabled' status for the featured addon, then it will not be displayed.
- If the partner has set 'Enabled' status for the featured addon, then it will be highlighted by "Non-clickable Green icon"
- If the partner has set 'Enabled, cannot be disabled' status for the featured addon, then it will be highlighted by "Clickable Red icon"
  - Once, the Red icon is clicked, the status changes to 'Enabled' and an entry is made to the "subscription_addon_enabled" table.
  - Now, the "Clickable Red icon" changes to "Clickable Green icon". This is to facilitate the user to Disable the addon temporarily.
  - Once, the Green icon is clicked, the addon status changes to 'Enabled, cannot be disabled', and the entry from the 'subscription_addon_enabled' table is deleted.

7) Find out the purpose of letter_layout table.
- No use ( Deleted )

8) Remove all the temp tables from egoria_erp_mirror and from test server (fields from table, if any)
- Removed

9) I think both these tables are not in use: tbl_product_attributes & tbl_product_attributes_relation
If yes delete them from local db, test server and db_change_log (excel)
- This tables are used to manage the automatic, HTML code generation for the, 'Call transfer option'

10) Find the purpose of "televakt_product_attributes"
- It is used for manage - Televakt category call rates

11) Show configuration option for all the below in customer portal too: User defined welcome message, User defined message outside opening hours, and Play busy outside opening hour

- RND autosuggest account number in manual journal
- Registering payments: After the payment has been registered, a javascript popup appears, returning the journal entry number. However, after this again, the ajax popup can close (now it remains open, the CSR has to click on the close button to proceed)
- In customer portal hide the "product tab" if product is not registered for customer
- In the customer portal:
  - Televakt subscription -> Departments:
	o This should trigger a list of departments. Each department in the list can be clicked to be edited. From the list view, new departments can also be created.
	o Notice also how buttons are incorrectly placed in the edit department view. Should be fixed
  - Users
        The add user section should start with an informative text stating that this adds a user to the company’s list of staff members.
	We should move the email input field to the top of the form, so that one does not have to enter names etc before the system looks to see if the email is registered already
	Also, we should mark required fields with an asterisk
	I furthermore suggest to move position and keywords above the alert method drop down.
	We should change the way keywords are input and stored: To the right of the input box, add a text that advice the user to separate keywords by comma. When keywords are being stored, each keywords should be stored separately in the db, and they should appear on a line below the keyword input box, together with a delete link, something like this:
		contracts (delete), wessels (delete)

- Feature request: I had a caller today referring to a customer of ours by their old customer name (the company has changed names recently), and I was unable to find that customer by searching in the ERP system. This lead me to think of a feature which could prove to be useful, and that is the ability to search for historical customer names. However, this should only be possible from the search function in the “Partner” list. I suggest that we add a checkbox to include historical names in the search carried out from this section and that the feature is disabled by default.
- RND for the requirement changes in Manual Journal section.

- New order - button (CSR):
The popup to select customer before registering a new order should also have the option of registering a new customer if the customer we'd want to place an order on behalf of does not exist. After registering the new customer, go to the order registration popup.

- Customer registration:
Currently when registering a new customer (CSR view), the CSR always have to fill out the contact person's name, even if that contact person exists in our database already. Hence, I suggest that we change the flow of registering new customers slightly, in that when it comes to registering the contact person, let the CSR enter the email address of the contact person first. If the email address does exist, populate the rest of the contact person fields with the registered data, which can be updated if needed (but changing name should trigger an alert). Password fields do not need to be displayed for existing contacts.

1) Restaurant search
Search seems to work well, although i noticed that there are some info.
on the original restaurant that is not on the test site ie. meigarden
fax no.

2) Write a review
When i click on Write a review, it presents me with a page to login or
click a link to register, which is fine. However, once logged in, i would like
to go to the restaurant that i originally clicked on for review - less the user
has to do, the better.

3) I logged in with my account menu23/menu23 and went to Approved restaurants in my My Acount, and clicked on Edit business for Georges Pleasure Pizza which throws me an error page.

4) Register a new restaurant:
Address 2 - should be optional
Web Address - should be optional

1) As far as the message content is concerned as specified in the attachment sent for the compose mail, it contains scam word 'help', hence the message is seen as "You have used a few scammed words"
List of scam words : money, help, red cross, USD, million, almighty, bank, securities, lottory, winner, business
2) As far as the sporadic (ocassional) behavior of "Message Inbox page" browser back button refreshing the same page is concerned, it might, be the browser cookie issue, you can check it by clearing the browser cookie.
I got the same issue when using Firefox, but once, cleared the cookies the problem was resolved, for other brosers like Chrome and Opera --- there seems to be no such issue.
If the problem still persists, then we shall look towards resolving it, but, I guess that's the browser issue, because the back button functionality is performed by the browser automatically depending on the cookies it stores.

Tasks Completed :: Jumpdates (26/03/2011)

1) Changes in the "Image nudity detector" as mentioned by pankaj sir.

Steps to test "Image nudity detector" ---
i) UPload a photo from jumpdates photos.
ii) If the script rated the uploaded photo less than 50, then the photo will be directly 'Approved'.
iii) If the script rates the photo more than 50, then the photo waits approval.
iv) If the photos were suspected for nudity. Then the suspected photos can be seen separately, in the Admin panel. (Admin ---> Users menu ---> Users Nudity photo)
v) Then from the admin panel, the admin can, either, Approve -- Decline -- Delete , the photos.
Note :: The script does really reduces the manual task of determining the nude photos to a ceratin extent, but, since, the script scans the color schema of the photo, it might be possible, tha un-nude photo may come under the nude section and or vice-versa.


2) As far as the "Jumpdates Forum" issue is considered, that, posting to "Announcement" section is not working --- as mentioned in the email.
Its working fine. I've tested this section as well as posting on other sections. You can check it on the test server.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: Jumpdates (25/03/2011)

1) Installation of the PHP script "Image nudity detector". 
2) Don't know whether this script can really validate the nude/porn photos, because, I have'nt check the script for such photos. Instead, I've checked the script on "Naked Baby Photos", and the script does manages to give the desired results of detecting Nudity.
3) The script actually scans the uploaded photo for a particular color range, and then gives it rating (out of 100). More the ratings, more likely the photo is Nude.

Tasks Completed :: reviewit (23/03/2011) 


NOTE : The following task were completed by Mohit and Me (Rahul) together as a team, because, previously, few things/changes were done by me and few by mohit. So, in order, to minimize the time loss, by first understanding the logic of previous coder, we decided to work together on the same points that we did previously. 


1) UI changes in "Activities home page", "Activity Details page" and Create a new activity page" , as specified in the attached document. (Only the create activity UI changes left, just about to finish)

1) Setup of new tab menu in the BP, (Facebook) Comments. The Comment menu could not be set in the Buddypress mail plugin, instead its been now implemented from the 'Buddypress Followers' plugin. But, the file to include new menus in BP, is created as a separate file, hence, if in future, any firther modifications and changes has to be implemented, then we can just make the desired changes in the that single file. If, the 'Buddypress Followers' plugin is uninstalled, then the Comments menu tab, will also disappear, but the code will remain intact in the plugins main directory, it can be reused from anywhere.
2) In the activities list, Highlight the most recent featured post separately just above the original list of activities.
3) Design changes in activities list page, as specified in the document.

2) Widget to display all the followers.
3) Widget to display all the followings.

Tasks Completed :: reviewit (18/03/2011)

1) Setup a new plugin to send mass mails to the selected registered users.
2) Since the "Mass Mails" plugin installed yesterday was not working properly, due to compatibility issues with Buddypress. Now, we are using "WP Mass Mails" plugin to send mass mails.
3) Tried to resolve the problem/compatibility issue of the "Mass maisl" plugin, but, the plugin seems to be not working properly still. Hence, installed a new plugin to perform the same feature of sending mass mails to the users.
4) The original "WP Mass mails" plugin had facility to send mails to only 'Commentators' (means all the users who have commented atleast once on any post). Now, the Code is modified, and the admin can send mail to all the registered users, in one shot of selection.
NOTE :: The mass mail option is now available in the Dashboard menu.

5) The new mass mails plugin functionality is not fully implemented. But, still the plugin is available on the live server.

Tasks Completed :: reviewit (17/03/2011)

1) Facility to Edit and Delete user activity. (This facility is available to the user who created the activity)
2) Only member user's can create an activity (means only registered user's have the facility to create an activity).
3) Remove tags widget from sidebar, as its visible in the footer.
4) The "view" link in the "user profile" section, to show the latest updates, (sets, to the default site homepage url) when the activity is shared from the activity list page, for all other case, the link redirects to the shared/joined post.
5) Mass mails plugin installed (This plugin allows the admin to send mails to all the wordpress users in one shot).

Point to consider ::

1) When the user is wordpress loggedin, means he's not FB loggedin, in this case, the user cannot join or even share an activity, because, to facilitate these features, the user must be FB logged in, as he's going to share the activity with his FB friends.
It simply means, that even if the user is wordpress loggedin, he needs to log with the FB account.

Suggestions :: Can't we depricate the facility to login and register from the wordpress ?? It would be better if we allow only FB users, since the registration and login process is automatically done by the FB connect plugin. This suggestion is mentioned by us, since, most of the site functionality requires FB login. Kindly, give a feedback on this ASAP.

Tasks Completed :: reviewit (15/03/2011)

1) After login, redirection of "Home" menu, to the homepage (Correction in the URL)
2) New methods to manage FB realted work in the class file.
3) Show the random FB user's 5 friends in the sidebar for only, "Activity list" and "Activity details" page.
4) When a new activity is created, '_wp_page_template' field in the postmeta table is updated with the template name 'single-showactivity.php'. This value is needed to identify, whether to show the sidebar FB friends list or not.
5) For now, in the activity list page, the sidebar shows the random friend list for the logged FB user. When he 'INVITES' a friend, following message is shared to the respective FB user's wall : "Site Title, Site Description and Site URL".
6) IN the activities page, "Share & Join buttons" are working as intended. If the logged user had created the activity, an option to share the activity "SHARE" button comes, on the other hand, if other user created the activity, the logged user then can join the activity via "JOIN" button.
And also the logged user can share any activity of any user, by simply clicking the "Share" link, just LHS to the "JOIN/SHARE" button. The "Share link" is only visible, fi the user is FB loggedin.
6) "Show Activities" button in the Search page of activities, that redirects back to the homepage URL.
7) Show list of users who have joined the activity in the sidebar.
8) Removed FB comments from the activity details page. Since, it gets into recursion, the page reloads again and again.
9) If the logged user has created the activity, and he's viewing the activity list, then he will see "SHARE" button instead of the "JOIN" button, for the activities created by him, all other activities will show "JOIN" button instead.

Case to consider ::
- IN the activities page, if the registered user is already logged in to the site (not with facebook), and he clicks "JOIN", so he will, be asked to login with the facebook account, in order to share activity with his FB friends. As a matter of fact, the user will not be enrolled to the activity untill and unless he logs with the facebook account, but in order to share the activity, FB login is mandatory.
- Make sure that a user is allowed to join an activity only once (means the entry in the table for that user is made only once.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks Completed :: Reviewit (10/03/2011)

- Create activity page.
- Activity done page.
- Share activity with facebook friends from the homepage, by clicking "JOIN" . Join page.







Tasks Completed :: Reviewit (09/03/2011)

- activity.php (Optimization of code)
- createactivity.class.php (Functions/methods definition)
- controller.php (An intermediate file to manage AJAX flow)
- activity_done.php (Managing the necessary data for as the final step for creating an activity, and publishing it)

- On "activitydone" page. If the user is not facebook user, then he's asked to log with facebook to share the activity, with facebook friends.
  Once the user logs with the facebook account, the page is refreshed and the facebook user's friends list is displayed and he then can share the activity with his friends.
- Share activity details on facebook is under work.


Points undone ::

1) Creation of unique "post_name" in table 'post', that will act as a slug for the post.
2) Tumbnail is not created for the profile image uploaded in the last step of create activity.












Poin to consider : When the user comes back to the createactivity page, and the session variable post_id isset, the records are shown but when the post button is clicked then it asks to update the previous step. Hence, creating a new activity.













Points left ::

1) Issue for the order of search result : "free dating sites - Part 1" , in jumpdates Blog.



Points Completed ::

1) Please find the attached snapshot with this mail. I wrongly added the thread to 'relationship issue' rather than 'dating experience'. I decided to delete it, now it looks like deleted from the category but it show in the list. when I click on that it is not available there.

Solution :: Note, the forum structure is like this : Group --> Forum --> Thread --> Post.
It means, if u delete a) Thread, then all the posts will get automatically deleted for that thread, b) If u delete a forum, then all the threads along with the posts of that forum will get deleted automatically, so on.
Also, if u have wrongly created a Thread in some other Forum, then from the Jumpdate's Admin panel for Forum, u can easily move that thread from one forum to other, without deleting it and then re-creating it in the desired forum.
Make sure, that a description is written for every thread that is created, as the description becomes the first post reply for your forum thread.


2) The blog google ad has been added to the LHS, just above the Jumpdates tower ad, in all the pages of the jumpdates Blog.

- search.php
- header.php
- archieve.php
- single.php

3) New button CSS changes, in jumpdates and blog main header menu buttons.

4) Arrangement of newsletter archieves in chronological order.

5) Facebook Like button on forum homepage.

6) If you login to your Facebook account, and open the jumpdates site on a new Tab, the when you go to the Forum page from home page, it will automatically log in. Can you check it on your PC? However, I am not clear about it because it shouldn't be possible!!! Isn't it?

Solution :: In no case, this will happen. The user will get automatically logged in jumpdates forum, only if he's currently logged in to the jumpdates. In no other case, the facebook user will automatically login the jumpdates forum.
Consider a case : If a user is logged with 'abc@jumpdates.com' to jumpdates site. Either directly or via facebook account with the same email as mentioned. Then the user will be automatically logged to the forum, with the same email id used for jumpdates.

7) In the Admin panel --> Admin Home : For users registered to jumpdates via facebook ( Facebook icon is shown, under Assoc Id). This point is implemented on test server.



** Reply to Soum's question : For implementing animated message on registration page of jumpdates.

Solution : I've added the JS code in the registration page (registration_one_child.html), but its not working. For future assistance, if you want to use  JS code on an HTML file in Jumpdates, please enclose the code inside {literal} js code .... {/literal} This ensures the use of smarty.

-------- Work Logger -------
- It will help in page speed optimization, if the default sizes of the snaps be as follows:
  Thumbnail = 120X100 px
  Big image = 1100X600 px
- Also, the average activity has to be an converted integer value.
- Also, the average activity (numerator value) seems to be coming wrong, since, its the measure of total keystrokes and mouse strokes. 
- When we use "Send Message" option, to communicate with theother user of the same project in consideration. Here, the user neither receives the mail nor an instant message. Here, if the, user was logged in, then a popup displaying the message should have been shown, if offline, then the email must have been sent.
- "Work Update" is not working. Its showing fatal error.
- The work logger setup seems to be machine dependent, because, if the configuration of the system changes, then the pre-requirements for the work logger, changes. (Here, am talking about, the .NET framework setup files). Suggest, the most compatible, pre-requisites for installing the work logger on a normal machine with windows xp sp2 installed in it.
- After the user has logged, there is no place from where atleast the logged user's name can be determined. There should have been some place where the currently logged user information can be viewed.
- Whenever any, option (like, send message, work_updates, etc) is triggered, from the work logger, the machine gets hangs/slowed down till that process is completed.
- It would be nice, if on double click, the current logged in user & the selected project information is displayed in a popup, rather than logging out the user. The user should be logged out , when he clicks, logout.
- It would be very nice, if the snaps_per_hour (specified in the tool_preference table), are taken at random interval of time, (also make sure that the random time interval is not more than 5 or 10 minutes as per the requirement).
- Even though, in the tool_preference table, the snaps_per_hour value is set to 20 (means snap after every 3 minutes). But, this is'nt so here. Because its considering 12 minutes(means 5 snaps per hour).
- When the user logs, the snaps are taken after every 12 minutes of interval. Hence, the 1st snaps is available, after 12 minutes, the user has actually logged, and since the logged in time of the user is calculated on the basis of the snaps time. The, logged in time, we will get here, is not the actual time the user was/is logged.
- One more, drawback for the above point, is that, the user has to be logged atleast 12 minutes, in order to make there work taken into consideration.

Admin Portal (Subscription transfer)::
- Declined --> Notification mail not received to either.
- Cancel   --> Notification mail not received to either.
- Accept   --> Notification mail not received to either. Again, Accept/Decline buttons are visible, in admin panel. Now, from here, when the admin selects either accept/decline, the mails can be sent.

6) In admin contact list show a column for "verified/ not verified"
7) Order view: Please remove the following columns when viewing a single order:
	- Product type
	- Included     (This field is not available. Does it mean something else ?? )
8) Then, expand the order status column so that it doesn't take two lines to show the "Manuell behandling" status ("manual authorization")
9) I tried registering a transfer for an order where one domain name did not have an EPP code set at NORID. This orderline used the variable awaiting_epp_code in the client orderline view, while in the CSR view it used the transfer variable awaiting_reg_status. It might have something to do with external/internal statuses, but still we should differentiate EPP-codes from one-time tokens, as EPP codes are usually gotten by contacting the current registrar, while one-time tokens we can issue ourselves (directly, or indirectly through NORID). Hence, the status should not reflect EPP-code if it isn't an EPP-code to be fetched. It also appears as some translation is not showing up correctly in the CSR order view, in particular in regards to order line statuses. E.g. I get tr('order_status', STATUS) instead of just STATUS.
   NOTE :: For this point, only, a new translation field 'STATUS' is added to the 'order_status' array.
10) Also, for the customer I don't think we really need to display the configure link in the order view. Instead I think if the order has already been submitted, then the customer can hold off with the configuration until after it has been transferred, at least for now. Instead, we should display a link to add EPP-key or one-time code (depending on which needs to be added) if we're awaiting one of these.
    Here, The Configure link will be visible, when the customer_order_line is not empty for the selected order_id and the domain_operation is 'Tranfer'. (Ref = order no.: 7282)

Algorithm :: Configure the domain from the customer portal for the seleted order.

if(domain_tld == '.no')

if(epp_sel_option == '' && auth protect = y)

  show a drop down box with, the following fields,
   1.) Auth code

Finally, if the contact_person_name available is blank, then we consider the contact person for billing.

Center column should have the following fields:

Order method
Placed by
Validated by (should always contain a value, set to the customer contact if no validation process has been started because the order was placed through the cart by one with necessary privileges to do so. If order is registered by the CSR, but with no validation process, then the CSR should be confronted with a popup requesting how the validation has been carried out (Phone, email), a field to select contact from a list and an optional note field. This is all added to the order history, and the name selected in the drop down should become visible in the validated by field).
TOS Accepted
Promo code
Comment (only visible if a comment has been registered with the order)

Order history tab:

5) This tab should contain order history lines, so if more entries exist, then they are divided into entry lines. E.g. The current order history note field, if anything is entered here, then it should appear in the history as a CSR note which can be clicked to be viewed.

6) Then, I suggest instead of the mail sent to and contact person columns, that we have a destination field. This can contain the name of the contact person and the address (be it email or phone number) in a parenthesis following the name, for domain registration the name of the module (e.g. NORID, Enom). Third column can be a Notes field. This can contain the domain name for domain actions, and can be left blank where it's not natural to fill in extra notes for the associated action.


7) Then we add a last column, Attachments, where one can see the raw output of the communication with the registry API, or view/download the associated document/email if the history is in regards to something that has been sent to a contact.

- When creating a new order, ADMIN CONTACT : This information will be of the customer contact person assigned as an Admin. While, the Billing and Technical Contact : This will be the information of the Partner contact person. Issue is with the phone number, the phone number should be the same (i.e., phone number of the customer/partner respectively, since country validation has to be done). The following fields are considered from the respective contact person information :: First name, Last name, Country, Phone number, Fax & Email. NOTE: When the contact is changed and if the contact phone number is fully blank, then the ccode will be +47, so its necessary to atleast have the ccode available in the phone number, so update the phone number as ccode only if the phone number is left blank when a new contact is created.
- Whent the contact person is changed for a particular contact person type, make sure, that the previous contact_id is over-written and that whent he custom is selected the contact_id remain blank, indicating a no-update of the contact person details.

8) Shopping cart popup (transfer): Please make sure that the drop down with the various options for sending EPP keys etc. is wide enough to display the text that goes with it. Currently some text is cut off.
9) Todo-list: It might be necessary with a short description of what actually needs to be done in addition to a reference to the order.

Prepay/postpay customer
1) partner_setting (customer_nature: prepay, postpay, both)
2) customer (customer_natute: prepay, postpay, both: default postpay)
- If in partner setting if customer_nature=both
  - Show a drop down in customer registration form to set it.
  - If in partner setting customer nature is either postpay or prepay
    assume all customers in same group and hence dont offer option to set it.
  - If in partner setting table option is "Both" a drop down should appear in
  customer card to edit it.

The Case -> Case Preference page: Remove the interest rate. Then, take the
remaining contents and insert the remaining items as a new tab under the
Setup->General section, to the right of the Reminders tab. Then, rename the
General section to "Financials".

Let's create a new section under "Setup", which we call Documents. Within
this section, let's move the contents of "Email" and "Sales documents" to
their own tabs instead of having them appear directly from the main menu.

The Case-> Actions list would be a natural ingredient of the Case tab under
Setup->Financials, so let the contents of the current "Case->Actions" be
inserted to the top of that tab, and move the rest of the content towards
the bottom.

Let's define interest rate in the "Reminders" tab, and not in the case setup
tab.

Then, back to the customer portal, under Orders, and then click any order.
The column all the way to the right for each order line, the one containing
the order status, can the name of that column be changed to just "Status"?

- Considering the creation of monthly report. It is mentioned that there should be client name and month and the year selection. Almost the same type of report is generated in the Audit report, if, monthly report has to be generated, then the selection in the Audit panel can be done for that particular range. If its, other than this, then am confused as, to who should this facility be available for, and what to do with it. Because, the PDF format you send, does not specify, that the report is for a particular client or the report for all the clients. Eg:: ERP, TELEVAKT, EGORIA ,etc   all these are clients or the project name ???? If they are client, then how to generate the report for each client for that selected month and year, also, what text is displayed after every name of the client/project ???
- Forgot password (section) will not work properly for the email address that is registered with different roles and different clients. Since, there is no method till now, to determine the uniqueness of the email address for a user. Say for eg:: If a user with email id xyz@abc.com is registered with the same email, with different roles and with different client, then the password shall be replaced for all that users, since no way to determine, which client and the role of the user, trying to request the password recovery.
- I have not implemented the permission criterias for the logged user, because, am not specific about who should have access to what features, also, how to restrict the user (denie permission).
- Created a cron script to delete the snaps older than 90 days (3 months).
- Created a crom script to send an alert email, regarding the trial account expiration, to all the clients, using trail account since 23 days.

- First of all, I didnt had clear picture/overview fo the project and the specification of the project features. I did coding as per instruction provided to me. But now since I have spend a lot of time on this project I've came to some coclusions, that the previous coding was very much restricted to some limited features and tasks, so I had to study most of the features carefully and had to make changes in most of the coding so that, it becomes efficient and feasible to work as per the requirement of the client.
- Changes like :::
	- Sending email to the user, for his registration, modification, etc. Prior, I did coding for both sending default mail format and the client mail format, and also send the email in a particular format, but actually it was sending only the default format, because I didnt knew what to do with client mail, thought it was just to save the client format, but after Pankaj bhaiyya explained me the purpose of client mail, then I decided to make the mail format selection specific according to the selection. Now the client, can select his own mail type and also change the mail format, to send the mail to the user when needed.
	- The listing of the users in (manage team) and that of the milestones in (manage milestones), is now as desired, in columnar form (i.e., newspaper style).
	- and also, some small small, bugs and design issues, when viewed and considered on diferent browsers.
	- rest of the thing I dont, remember.
- If there are still any malfunctioning of the features, please tell me, I will correct them again, to work properly. But I have tested most of them for all type of data, so hardly there might be some error.

- After this step, we can add /pulic/projects_documents/projnum_projname/ , this folder will contain all the project information/details. Use fwrite() to create a folder.
- Added a new field, into the projects table of projectOB, named project_folder, that will store the above file path. Also created a new field in the mantis_project_table for referencing the project id value.
- Before entering these values into the project table, create trigger and stored procedures to link the details with the bugtracker's mantis_project_table.
- Insert all the required fields and update both the tables accordingly.
- Access was deneid for creating triggers on the server database, so instead of triggers, created functions for user and project table operation and then called the respective stored procedures for the same.
- Created a menu in the menu bar, for bugtracker, for the current purpose, we can view all the linked project details that are created by the client.
